# US-Travel-Data 
US travel Data gotten from Onyx Data February Challenge of the number of Americans that travelled outside the country within 1990 - 2021.

I was curious about the countries Americans travelled the most and the least, I was also curious in knowing the time the travelled the most.
I was however concerned that they are some continents did not have any guest from America, not even for business purposes.
